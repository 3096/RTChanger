# RTChanger

RTChanger is a WIP homebrew application for the Nintendo 3DS system. RTChanger will allow you to change the Raw RTC of your system.
Changing the Raw RTC allows you to bypass most timegates in games. For example, you can do Poke Pelago activities much faster in Pokemon Sun or Pokemon Moon. 

There are many applications in different games as some games have more than one time gate.

# What is the Raw RTC?

Your system has a special hidden clock inside that continues to move forward just like the regular clock and cannot be changed outside of normal circumstances. Upon booting, many games check for differences in the RTC (Your normal system clock) and Raw RTC. Games can detect whether you changed your system clock. However, changing the Raw RTC prevents the games from detecting that if done properly.

# Q&A

Q: What is required for this?
A: This is a .CIA file and requires Custom Firmware and Boot9Strap. The preferred CFW is Luma3DS, but you can choose one at your own descretion. .CIA files are installed with FBI, as you should have gotten it installed in www.3ds.guide. 

Q: Will there be a .3DSX version?
A: I will consider making one, but be aware that Rosalina (and therefore Luma3DS) will still be required due to the escalated permissions needed.

Q: This involves the MCU. Is this safe?
A: Yes. What you may have heard was that changing the color of the LED can brick the MCU, but even then that was only for firmware versions below 8.0.0. You're safe to use this application.

Q: Is this legally redistributable?
A: Yes!

Q: Will there be any updates to this?
A: I don't honestly see the point of updating this once it's released. Unless a critical bug arises, there's really nothing else to be done with this application in particular.

Sono (AKA MarcusD). I would not have even started this project if it weren't for him. I am very new to coding and he has and currently is helping me with this project. A very, very helpful person.

The 3DSHacks #dev community on Discord. I had quite a few questions to ask there.
